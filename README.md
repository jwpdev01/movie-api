Since college when I worked in a video store, I have had a love of movies.  I wanted to create an application that would 
allow the user to quickly search for a movie and be able to watch the movie trailer in one site.

The application allows the usre to enter a movie title and displays data in 3 columns.  Column one consists of movie plot, 
actors, movie ratings and run time.

The second column presents the movie title, year of release and image of the movie poster.

The last column displays three links to youtube relating to the searched upon movie trailer.
